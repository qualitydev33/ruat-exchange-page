                    <span className='text-22px'>Does Nexo Have Fees?</span>
                    <span className='mt-3'>Platforms like Nexo operate differently than out and out trading platforms like Binance. As such, Nexo charges a spread estimated at around 2% on transactions. Nexo charges gas fees on crypto withdrawals; to carry out the withdrawal and to add the transaction to the blockchain. Beyond that, the only other fees are associated with withdrawals, but they are based on a tier system (mentioned below) based on the amount of NEXO tokens held in the account in question. The loyalty tier below accounts for how many free withdrawals are allowed per month:</span>

                    <span className='mt-3'>Sadly, when it comes to fees, there is no definitive answer, as Nexo doesnâ€™t disclose their spread. Nexo does allow users to avoid extra fees or penalties on crypto-backed loans.</span>
